# ðŸ§  Emotion Recognition from PPG & HR Signals

This repository contains a full pipeline for preprocessing, feature extraction, normalization, and machine learning applied to heart rate (HR) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals recorded during emotional video stimuli.

The extraction features codes are labeled with HR and PPG because the HR feature is given by imotions software while the PPG is a raw signal, which is preprocessed and showed better results at the moment of modelling the machine models algoritmns. Thefore, the codes which terminate with _PPG are the most valuable.

## Pipeline Overview

### `1. PPG_HR_Longer_Intervals.py`
Preprocesses raw CSV files containing PPG and HR data:
- Detects and sets headers
- Applies Butterworth high-pass and low-pass filters to remove noise and baseline drift
- Cleans and imputes heart rate signals using forward fill, backward fill, and interpolation
- Normalizes timestamps and adjusts intervals per stimulus
- Splits/merges video intervals and reassigns survey timestamps to target videos
- Standardizes stimulus names and exports clean files

> **Note:** The intervals are based in GSR intervals but pretending to have at least 15 seconds per stimuli where possible, that is the reason why some time from the surveys is taken and appened to the stimuli.

### '1.5. PSD_plots'
For checking the Power Spectral Density Values of each video. 

### `2. Time_Frequency_Features_Extraction.py`
Extracts classical HRV features in the time and frequency domains from the filtered signals.

---

### `3. PoincarePlos_Features_HR.py`
Plots poincarÃ© plots and Calculates non-linear HRV metrics from PoincarÃ© plots.

---

### `4. merging_all_features.py`
Merges time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear features into a single feature matrix per participant and video.

---

### `5. Features_Norm_Grey_Cal_Start.py`
Normalizes all features using the "Grey Calibration Start" baseline as a reference.  
This enables within-subject comparisons across different stimuli.

---

### `6. Features_Arousal_Join.py`
Joins subjective arousal ratings from survey responses with the corresponding physiological feature vectors.

---

### `7. Correlation_plots_csv.py`
Computes and visualizes correlation matrices between HRV features and arousal labels.  
Useful for identifying which physiological signals are most predictive of arousal.

---

### `8. HRV_ML.ipynb`
Machine learning pipeline for arousal prediction based on HRV features:
- Cross-validation using **Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO)**
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearch**
- Model evaluation using **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **RÂ²**
- Feature importance analysis
